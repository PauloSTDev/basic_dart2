# Dart
## Variables and Values Assignments
### Naming Variables:
Variables names can be any valid letter, word or even sentence but it can not start with a number, the number can be at the middle or at the end. We can use underline at the beginning, we can not use at the end and at the middle of a variable. We can not use any operator(+, - ...) or any special caracter in your variable name. Private variables has a underline at the beginning(_variable).
## Classes
We can not use underline at the middle or at the end, just at the beginning, making the class private, the beginning letter must to be uper case, we can use uper case at the middle or at the end.

❗ All the packages, libraries, directories and source files will be named with lower case, usying underline to separe the words ❗
